## Threat Intelligence – Hash Analysis

I analyzed the file hash using VirusTotal.

* The file was flagged as malicious by multiple security vendors
* This confirms that the document is weaponized, likely containing malicious macros

## Endpoint Investigation

I investigated the endpoint associated with the alert (172.16.17.37) using the Endpoint Security page on LetsDefend platform.

* The last recorded activity on the endpoint was March 7, 2021
* The alert was generated on March 14, 2021

This time gap made it unreliable to depend solely on timestamp-based filtering.



* I identified two suspicious PowerShell commands in the terminal history as shown below

  
   ![Alert Details](/SIEM-investigations/Malicious-File-Alert/screenshots/Obfuscated-Commands.png)
  
* The commands appeared obfuscated, indicating possible attacker activity
* There were no logs available after March 7, which may indicate logging gaps or endpoint inactivity

## Log and Network Investigation

I further analyzed logs from the log management system.

* I identified three related events from March 7, 2021 as shown below
 ![Alert Details](/SIEM-investigations/Malicious-File-Alert/screenshots/The-Three-Events.png)
* I extracted the requested URLs from each event
  for example the first event's URL: ![Alert Details](/SIEM-investigations/Malicious-File-Alert/screenshots/Requested-URL.png)
* All URLs were confirmed malicious through VirusTotal analysis
 for example the Virus Total results of the first event's URL: ![Alert Details](/SIEM-investigations/Malicious-File-Alert/screenshots/1-Virustotal-Result.png)

### Observations:

* Various security vendors flagged the Requested URLs as malicious from each event
* There were no logs from the endpoint after March 7, suggesting possible evasion or inactivity

## Analysis

Based on my investigation, this alert corresponds to a confirmed malicious document delivery attempt.


* The SIEM system successfully blocked the download attempt
* Historical activity shows signs of PowerShell abuse, which is commonly used in post-exploitation

Although the file was blocked at the time of the alert, prior activity suggests that the endpoint may have been exposed to earlier malicious behavior.

---

## Response Actions

* The malicious file download attempt was blocked by the SIEM system
* I proceeded to contain the affected endpoint as a precautionary measure at the Endpoint Security page
* The threat was handled in line with containment procedures, preventing further risk to the system

## Outcome

True Positive

The alert correctly identified a real malicious attempt, and appropriate defensive measures were successfully applied.

---

## Recommendations

1. Enable continuous and centralized endpoint logging to prevent visibility gaps
2. Restrict and monitor PowerShell usage, especially for obfuscated commands
3. Implement email filtering to block or sandbox macro-enabled attachments
4. Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for better visibility
5. Conduct user awareness training on phishing and malicious attachments

## Conclusion

The malicious file was successfully prevented from execution due to the SIEM blocking action. While no immediate compromise was observed during the alert, historical indicators suggest prior suspicious activity. Continuous monitoring and improved logging are recommended to enhance detection and response capabilities.
